#  Bitcoin Ticker

## The Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills you learned to make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. 

## What you will create

We’re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
